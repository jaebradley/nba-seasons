"The Charlotte Hornets franchise was established in 1988 as an expansion team owned by George Shinn. In 2002, Shinn moved the Hornets to New Orleans. They continued to play as the Hornets until 2013, when they changed their name to the New Orleans Pelicans. As part of an agreement with the NBA, Charlotte was granted a new franchise for the 2004–05 NBA season, the Charlotte Bobcats. In 2013, the Bobcats announced that they would change their name to the Charlotte Hornets once again for the 2014–15 season. On the day the Bobcats changed their name to the Hornets, they reclaimed the history and records of the 1988–2002 Hornets. As a result, the Hornets were retconned as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2014."

"On May 21, 2013, Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of the franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 NBA season, pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas on July 18, 2013."

"At a press conference regarding the change, team officials also announced that as part of a deal with the NBA and the renamed New Orleans Pelicans, Charlotte acquired the history and records of the 1988–2002 Hornets (in a move similar to that of the National Football League's Cleveland Browns return to the league in 1999), while all of the Hornets' records during their time in New Orleans from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans. The Hornets are now retconned as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are considered a 2002 expansion team."
