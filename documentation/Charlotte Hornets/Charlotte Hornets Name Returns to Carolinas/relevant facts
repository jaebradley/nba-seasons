"In addition, the team announced that after collaborating with the NBA and the New Orleans Pelicans, all of the statistical information, records and history of Charlotte NBA basketball will also be returning to the franchise. The Hornets will now own and have access to all of the historical elements from not only the Bobcats era (2004-2014) but also the original Hornets era in Charlotte (1988-2002). The Pelicans will maintain the history and statistics beginning with the team’s first season in New Orleans (2002-03)."

"The Hornets was the name of the city’s first NBA franchise from 1988-2002. The NBA returned to Charlotte in 2004 as the Bobcats and played under that name from 2004-2014.  On May 21, 2013, Jordan announced that the organization had applied to change its name to the Charlotte Hornets, a move that was approved unanimously by the NBA Board of Governors on July 18, 2013."
